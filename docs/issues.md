# 🐛 Issues & Inconsistencies Found

## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. **Missing Core Features**
- **Wave System**: Game currently spawns asteroids infinitely instead of structured waves
- **Victory Condition**: No way to win the game (should win after 8 waves)
- **Game State Management**: No proper Game Over or Victory screens
- **Roguelike Elements**: Missing upgrade system between waves

### 2. **Incomplete Enemy Types**
According to design document, should have 4 enemy types:
- ✅ **Asteroid** (implemented)
- ❌ **Kamikaze** (missing - should home toward player)
- ❌ **Gunner** (missing - should fire projectiles)
- ❌ **Leaper** (missing - should move in zigzag pattern)

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 3. **Audio System Missing**
- No background music
- No sound effects (shooting, explosions)
- Audio files not present in assets

### 4. **Code Quality Issues**
- Console.log statements left in production code
- Missing error handling
- Some magic numbers could be constants

## 🟢 Fixed Issues

### 5. **Debug Mode** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Physics debug was enabled in production~~
- ~~Debug graphics overlays were visible~~

### 6. **Documentation Inconsistencies** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Bullet direction description was unclear in design.md~~

2. **Add Wave System** - Replace infinite spawning with structured waves
3. **Create Kamikaze Enemy** - Simplest missing enemy type to implement
4. **Add Basic Audio** - At least explosion and shooting sounds
5. **Code Cleanup** - Remove debug logs and add proper constants
