## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. **Missing Core Features**
- **Wave System**: Game currently spawns enemies infinitely instead of structured waves
- **Roguelike Elements**: Missing upgrade system between waves

### 2. **Enemy Types** ✅ FIXED
All 4 enemy types implemented:
- ✅ **Asteroid** (implemented - straight movement)
- ✅ **Kamikaze** (implemented - homing enemy)
- ✅ **Gunner** (implemented - fires projectiles)
- ✅ **Leaper** (implemented - zigzag pattern movement)

### 3. **Advanced Audio Features Missing**
- ✅ Background music implemented (menu and game tracks)
- ✅ Sound effects implemented (shooting, explosions)
- ✅ Volume controls exposed to user

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 4. **Remaining Refactoring Opportunities**
- Enemy classes could be extracted into separate files
- Bullet system could be its own class
- Wave/spawn system needs separate module

---

## 🟢 Fixed Issues

### 5. **Code Quality Issues** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Console.log statements left in production code~~
- ~~Missing error handling~~
- ~~Some magic numbers could be constants~~

### 6. **WASD Controls** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Only arrow keys work, but PRD specifies W/S support~~

### 7. **Code Organization** ✅ FIXED
- ~~GameScene.ts was too large (552 lines)~~
- ~~Player logic was mixed with scene management~~
- ~~No separation of concerns~~

### 8. **Game State Management** ✅ FIXED
- ~~No proper Game Over or Victory screens~~
- ~~No restart functionality~~

### 9. **Collision System** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Physics debug was enabled in production~~
- ~~Debug graphics overlays were visible~~
- ~~Collision detection sizing issues~~

### 10. **Object Pooling** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Destroyed asteroids stayed in place~~
- ~~Pool exhaustion possible~~
