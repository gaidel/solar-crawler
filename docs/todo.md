## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. **Missing Core Features**
- **Wave System**: Game currently spawns asteroids infinitely instead of structured waves
- **Roguelike Elements**: Missing upgrade system between waves
- **Additional Enemy Types**: 2 of 4 enemy types implemented

### 2. **Incomplete Enemy Types**
According to design document, should have 4 enemy types:
- ✅ **Asteroid** (implemented)
- ✅ **Kamikaze** (implemented - homing enemy)
- ❌ **Gunner** (missing - should fire projectiles)
- ❌ **Leaper** (missing - should move in zigzag pattern)

### 3. **Audio System Missing**
- No background music
- No sound effects (shooting, explosions)
- Audio files not present in assets

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 4. **Code Quality Issues**
- Console.log statements left in production code
- Missing error handling
- Some magic numbers could be constants

---

## 🟢 Fixed Issues

### 5. **Game State Management** ✅ FIXED
- ~~No proper Game Over or Victory screens~~
- ~~No restart functionality~~

### 6. **Collision System** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Physics debug was enabled in production~~
- ~~Debug graphics overlays were visible~~
- ~~Collision detection sizing issues~~

### 7. **Object Pooling** ✅ FIXED
- ~~Destroyed asteroids stayed in place~~
- ~~Pool exhaustion possible~~

## 🎯 Priority Tasks for Next Session

1. **Wave System** - Implement structured waves instead of infinite spawning
2. **Kamikaze Enemy** - Add homing enemy type (simplest to implement)
