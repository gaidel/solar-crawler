## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. **Missing Core Features**

- **Roguelike Elements**: Missing upgrade system between waves

### 2. **Enemy Types** ✅ FIXED
All 4 enemy types implemented:
- ✅ **Asteroid** (implemented - straight movement)
- ✅ **Kamikaze** (implemented - homing enemy)
- ✅ **Gunner** (implemented - fires projectiles)
- ✅ **Leaper** (implemented - zigzag pattern movement)

### 3. **Advanced Audio Features Missing**

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 4. **Remaining Refactoring Opportunities**
- Enemy classes could be extracted into separate files
- Bullet system could be its own class
- Wave/spawn system needs separate module
