# Solar Crawler

Solar-themed arcade shooter where each run is unique.

**Solar Crawler** is a browser-based side-scrolling space shooter with roguelike elements.

You pilot a spacecraft through dangerous regions of space, moving vertically while the background scrolls horizontally. The ship fires automatically, and enemies appear in procedurally generated patterns. Between waves, you collect random upgrades that shape each run differently.

## 🧪 How to Run

If the game uses only basic scripts and assets, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

If the game uses ES modules, you'll need to serve it with a local web server (e.g., using `npx serve`, VSCode Live Server, or Python's built-in `http.server`).
